# Now Lets us understand what is churn
Churn prediction means knowing which customers are likely to terminate the service or  cancel the service subscription.</br>

This is an important forecast for many companies, as attracting new customers often costs more than retaining existing ones.

Once you have identified the customers who are at risk of churn, you need to understand exactly what marketing measures you should take for each  customer to maximize their chances of staying. Different customers have different behaviors and preferences, so we cancel your subscription for a variety of reasons. Therefore, it is important to actively communicate with each of them in order to keep them on the customer list. You need to know which marketing campaigns are most effective for your individual customers and when they are most effective.

# Why churn?
Customer attrition is a common problem for companies in many industries. If you want to grow as a company, you have to invest in acquiring new customers. Every time a customer leaves the company, it means a significant investment loss. Replacing them takes both time and effort. Predicting when your customers may leave and encouraging them to stay can save you a lot of money on your business. 
 Therefore, understanding what  is blocking the customer is of great value as it helps to develop  retention strategies and implement operational practices aimed at preventing the customer from leaving the home. I have. Churn rate forecasts are true for all subscription businesses, and even small fluctuations in churn rates can have a significant impact on revenue. You need to know "Will this customer  leave us within X months?" Yes or no? This is a binary classification task.
